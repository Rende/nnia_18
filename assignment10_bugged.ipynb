    "Here you will implement a simple, but efficient Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in TensorFlow for image classification task on CIFAR-10 dataset ([link and description](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html), but please note that the section \"Baseline results\" is completely outdated). \n",
    "\n",
    "We strongly recommend you first to go through a very good [tutorial from TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/mnist/pros). You can borrow implementation details from them, especially for convolutions and pooling layers, but make sure to implement our architecture! If you just apply the architecture from that tutorial to CIFAR-10 dataset, you will not receive many points. And please note, that this tutorial considers MNIST dataset, which has grayscale digits. However, CIFAR-10 has images in RGB. There is also another [tutorial by TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/deep_cnn), which shows AlexNet architecture (now outdated!) applied to CIFAR-10. But it is much more advanced than the first one.\n",

But unfortunately, really deep CNNs cannot be trained on ordinary laptops.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementation details:\n",
    "- Initialize your weights with He initialization (for your interest, [original paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.01852.pdf)), which is simply a normal distribution with mean=0 and std=sqrt(2/n), where n is the number of connections from the previous layer to a neuron on the current layer (e.g. for 1st conv. layer we have $n=5 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 3$, for 2nd conv. layer $n=4 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 10$, etc).\n",
    "- Convolution should preserve dimensions (use 'SAME'). \n",
    "- Global average pooling means that we simply average all our values inside each feature map. So on the 3-rd convolutional layer we have 30 feature maps of size 8x8. After global average pooling we get only 30 values of averaged 8x8 feature maps.\n",
    "- Use ReLU as activaton function\n",
    "- We use softmax + cross-entropy loss, and no elementwise sigmoids. Make sure that you use average cross-entropy per batch in order to make an update! Otherwise recommended lambda and learning rate will not be a good choice.\n",
    "- For optimization you can use Adam with the learning rate given above (0.005), and all other parameters set by default. \n",
    "- Please train the model for 10 epochs with batch size = 100. Please note, that 10 epochs is not actually a lot, and we can get substantial improvement if we go beyond 10 epochs. We just want to be sure that 10 epochs can be done in a reasonable amount of time on any kind of laptop that you may have.\n",
    "- Use TensorBoard to **display the computation graph** defined by your model. Additonally, use TensorBoard to **log the test error, training error and training loss function** of your network for each epoch (again, you can use [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/summaries_and_tensorboard) for reference). To speed up the training process, it's not necessary to report training accuracy on all 50000 examples, you can just take first 1000 examples.\n",
    "- Don't forget about L2 regularization of all weights (both convolutional and fully connected). Recommended $\\lambda$ is 0.0001.\n",
    "- Of course, feel free to use different hyperparameters if you find better ones."

    "\n",
    "a. Now we will try to understand what CNNs actually learned. Let's do the following:\n",
    "- Visualize all convolutional filters on all the layers. So you have to visualize 10 conv. filters (5x5) on the 1st layer, 20 conv. filters (4x4) on the 2nd layer and 30 conv. filters (3x3) on the 3-rd layer. Note, that each filter on the 1st layer has 3 input channels, which correspond to red, green and blue colors, so you can display them **in color**. And each filter on other layers has more input channels that have nothing to do with color. So you can just pick 1 of the input channels and display all conv. filters (again, 20 on 2nd layer and 30 on 3rd layer) **in grayscale** that correspond to a particular input channel. Please, provide here a few received images that you find interesting. (1 point)\n",
    "- Visualize all feature maps (of size 32x32, 16x16, 8x8), i.e. values of neurons after applying activation function (and before the pooling operation) for each convolutional layer for any 5 training examples. Please, provide here a few received images that you find interesting. (1 point)\n",
    "- Can you notice some interesting patterns on the visualizations? Are all images perfectly interpretable? Discuss both images of convolutional filters and of feature maps on different layers. Are there duplicate filters that look almost identical? (1 point)\n",
    "\n",
    "b. And now about the optimization process:\n",
    "- Modify your code to plot the L2 norm of flattened gradients of the weights of each layer after each epoch. So your gradient for a convolutional layer is a tensor of dimension n_in x width x height x n_out (obtained by Optimizer.compute_gradients(loss)), so you should flatten it into a long vector and then take L2 norm of it. Please, also include the gradient magnitude immediately after random initialization. Make sure to calculate gradient magnitudes on the training set (or again, you can use only a subset of 1000 examples). (2 points)\n",
    "- (BONUS, 3 points) Can you explain why the gradient magnitude doesn't always decrease over time? Can you confirm the picture from Deep Learning book on the page 281, figure 8.1, where the gradient magnitude strictly grows with training? \n"
